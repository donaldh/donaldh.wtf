* Netlink and YNL

I am officially now a maintainer of the [[https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro-specs.html#ynl-lib][YNL library]] and [[https://docs.kernel.org/networking/netlink_spec/index.html][Netlink specifications]] that live in the
Linux kernel git repository.

* Zero Trust

Having spent the last 20+ years focused on networking technologies, I am now enjoying a bit of a
pivot to Zero Trust architectures. Sure, there's still a lot of networking in Zero Trust, but
there's also some interesting new problems related to identity and attestation as well as the
need for compliance auditing and maturity assessment.
