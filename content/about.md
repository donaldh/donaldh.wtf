A *veteran* software engineer working at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) where I explore
and evangelise emerging technologies, with a focus on Linux networking.

* [Linux kernel networking](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/)
* [eBPF](https://ebpf.foundation)

I write articles for the [Red Hat Developer blog](https://developers.redhat.com/blog) when I
can:

* [eBPF application development: Beyond the basics](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/10/19/ebpf-application-development-beyond-basics#ebpf_101___a_brief_recap)
* [Why you should use io_uring for network I/O](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/04/12/why-you-should-use-iouring-network-io)

I used to work in the telecom industry, where I was involved with a variety of internal and open
source projects.

I used to be an active member of MEF, contributing to MEF Implementation Projects.

I am a bit of a [Raku](https://raku.org/) fanboy and contribute to Raku projects when I can.
