Keeping the legacy of Sir Terry Pratchett alive forever.
For as long as his name is still passed along the Clacks,
Death can't have him.

The idea of memorialising Terry Pratchett in the ~clacks~ is describe here:

[[http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com]]

I added the ~X-Clacks-Overhead~ header to my webserver config a while back and prompty forgot all
about it. Here's a screen cap of the response headers:

It's also lurking in my DNS:

#+begin_src sh :results output
host -t txt donaldh.wtf
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: donaldh.wtf descriptive text "X-Clacks-Overhead: GNU Terry Pratchett"
