I think I have finally found a blogging platform that makes me happy. It needs to fit my
programmer's workflow – git, markup and blogging about code. Hugo with org-babel nails it.

<!--more-->

Hugo is a really nice open-source static site generator - [[https://gohugo.io/]]. It supports a
variety of markup formats including the ubiquitous markdown, but also Emacs Org Mode files. This
opens the way to using org-babel for blogging with inline code snippets that can be
evaluated. Hello literate blogging! And did I mention polyglot?

** How Easy?

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# create a new site
hugo new site donaldh.wtf

# add a theme

# create a new post
hugo new post/how-easy-is-it.org

# edit away

# try it locally
hugo serve -D
# open http://localhost:1313/

# publish
hugo && rsync -avz --delete public/ <destination>
#+END_SRC

** Tour Of Inlines

*** Shell
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo "Hello from shell!"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello from shell!

*** Inline C
#+BEGIN_SRC C
printf("Hello worldies!\n");
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello worldies!

*** Perl
#+BEGIN_SRC perl :results output
print "Hello World\n";
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello World

*** Sqlite
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :db users.db
select * from users;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Donald Hunter | donaldh | http://donaldh.wtf/ |

*** Introducing Perl 6

#+name: p6ver
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
$*PERL
#+END_SRC
And the version is:
#+RESULTS: p6ver
: Perl 6 (6.c)

I cannot remember the provenance of this ob-perl6 language driver. I think I found it on github
but it has since disappeared. You can get it from my dotfiles here:

[[https://github.com/donaldh/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/emacs.d.symlink/local/ob-perl6.el]]


How do you like your fibonacci:
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
(1, 1, * + * ... *)[^10].join: ', '
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55

*** Graphs With Dot
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file test-dot.png :exports results
digraph {
  a -> b
  a -> c
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:test-dot.png]]

** Bugs

Hugo uses [[https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous]] for parsing Org-mode files and it turns out
there are a few bugs. They look relatively simple to fix so I'll delve into that soon.

Update: Of course, now that the bugs are resolved, the static site generator made everything
below look fine.

*** Comment

#+BEGIN_SRC
 #+BEGIN_COMMENT
 Nobody expects any commentary.
 #+END_COMMENT
#+END_SRC
This generates spurious ~<p>~ tags inside a ~<pre>~ block, and syntax highlighting happens:
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Nobody expects any commentary.
#+END_COMMENT
When, in fact, comments should be ignored.

*** Quote
#+BEGIN_SRC org
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
#+END_SRC
This also adds ~<p>~ tags, this time inside a ~<blockquote>~, instead of ~<br/>~
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow
Everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go
#+END_QUOTE

*** Centered Text
#+BEGIN_SRC org
 #+BEGIN_CENTER
#+END_SRC
Same thing happening here:

#+BEGIN_CENTER
Hello centered world!
Why such spacing though?
#+END_CENTER

*** Verse
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow
Everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go
#+END_VERSE
