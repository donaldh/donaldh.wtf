What's going on here then? Chance pictures from an iPhone without any apparent skill at all.

* Pano

This first picture was taken in a relative hurry. Son was itching to drop into the bowl so I
just grabbed my phone and took a quick /pano/. The results, the lighting, the mood, are much
better than I expected to get.

* Almost Tilt-shift

This is even more surprising. We're on a chairlift and I'm twisted round in my seat. Phone
camera is popped onto /square/ and I'm hoping that I can hold it steady *and* keep the picture
in frame. The result is my favourite of the winter. It has an amazing tilt-shift feel to it.
