** Sinclair ZX81

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81][Sinclair ZX81]] was our first computer. Dad had brought home microcontroller based prototype
boards from work before, the kind that could be programmed from a hex keypad. But it was really
exciting to be getting a real computer. We got the kit that had to be soldered and built by
hand, which heightened the excitement as I watched patiently as Dad soldered all the
components. It didn't work on the first try – only after hours of cross-checking against the
build instructions did we discover that a resistor pack was the wrong way round.

Next came the challenge of learning what we could do with it. As I recall, the manual was good
at explaining Basic and at opening up the possibilities ahead. We pretty quickly hit the 1K
memory limits and built a 16K RAM pack from a kit. It suffered the same wobble problem as the
official RAM pack so ended up being rigidly fixed to ZX81 case with aluminium brackets.

Our ZX81, with an Analog to Digital converter board, served as a weather station for many years
– with terrible low-resolution graphs.

** Sinclair ZX Spectrum

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum][ZX Spectrum]] was hotly anticipated in our house, from the moment of the first press
release. It took a great deal of persuasion to get my parents to fork out for one so soon after
the ZX81.

My dad used the Spectrum as a word processor, using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasword][Tasword]] to write his travel journals. We
ended up getting all the accessories, including [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Microdrive][Microdrives]] and the very dubious [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Printer][ZX Printer]].

I have very fond memories playing games like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atic_Atac][Atic Atac]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpac][Jetpac]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner][Manic Miner]] as well as
starting to learn Z80 assembly language.

*** Interface 1

The Microdrives came with an adapter module called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Interface_1][Interface 1]] that also had an RS232 serial
interface. This opened up the world of communications to us and with an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler][Acoustic coupler]] we were
able to dial up bulletin boards.

I remember long evenings at computer club meetings where we'd take turns with the phone line,
trying to connect to bulletin boards and share our achievements with the world.

** Teletype

One day Dad came home with this hulking great [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33][Teletype]] that he had salvaged from a skip at
work. It was slow, noisy and only had an upper-case ASCII character set, but it was still a huge
step up from the ZX Printer.

The Teletype had a punched tape reader and writer, which was an entertaining but painfully slow
way to save and load programs. It was a noisy beast and I recall it had a sound deadening
enclosure which quietened it down to merely being noisy instead of deafening.

** Amstrad CPC 6128

After the ZX Spectrum we had various upgrades including a Spectrum+ but things really stepped up
when we bought an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC][Amstrad CPC 6128]]. This was considered a **proper computer** because it could run [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M][CP/M]].

[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Schneider_CPC6128_white.jpg/600px-Schneider_CPC6128_white.jpg]]

The Amstrad CPC also had an integral 3 inch floppy drive so we finally entered the world of
fast, reliable loading and saving. There was also better graphics and an actual sound chip.

** Amstrad PC1640

And then came the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC1512][Amstrad PC1640]], our entry into the IBM-PC compatible world and MS-DOS.

[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Schneider_Amstrad_PC_1512_DD_Transparent_BG.png/500px-Schneider_Amstrad_PC_1512_DD_Transparent_BG.png]]

Like all our computers before it, the Amstrad PC was relegated to running as a weather station
when it eventually got superseded. The weather station was expected to run 24/7 and this exposed
an unfortunate bug in the BIOS. After a certain amount of time, maybe 2 or 3 days – I can't
remember, the machine would lock up. After doing the maths we figured it was an integer overflow
in the BIOS clock code. As a workaround I managed to develop a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminate_and_stay_resident_program][TSR]] that would wake up and reset
the counter before the overflow occurred.

All this in 5 years! Happy days.
