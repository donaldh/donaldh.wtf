# summary text

Inspired to add a "now" page to my site.

<!--more-->

# content

I have recently seen a few [[https://nownownow.com/about]["now"]] pages on people's websites and felt inspired to add one [[/now][here]].
The thing about a "now" page is that it needs to be maintained, so I'm hoping that it will be a
kind of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_function][forcing function]] for me to update my site more frequently.

My [[/about]["about"]] page serves as a /resume/ that spans many years. It picks out the skills and
highlights of my professional career. That leaves plenty of room for the [[/now]["now"]] page to describe
current interests and focus areas. I guess there might be a bit of overlap between individual
blog posts and "now" content, whenever my interest spawn new posts or vice versa.
